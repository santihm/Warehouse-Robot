# Smart Warehouse Robot System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Smart Warehouse System using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The primary objective is to demonstrate the student's understanding of key ROS concepts, including nodes, topics, services, parameters, and custom messages. The system simulates robot navigation within a warehouse to optimize storage and retrieval processes, showcasing how multiple robotic components communicate and coordinate with each other.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the architecture of the Robot Operating System (ROS).
- Demonstrate communication between ROS nodes using topics, messages, and services.
- Manage and implement parameters in ROS.
- Create and use custom message types for data exchange between robots.
- Develop and use services for task management in the warehouse system.

The project also emphasizes creating custom services and messages beyond those provided by Gazebo to showcase a deeper understanding of ROS customization.

### Context

The project simulates a warehouse automation system. The primary focus is on optimizing warehouse operations, such as loading, unloading, and navigation tasks for robots within a dynamic environment. Using ROS, this system demonstrates how robots interact and perform coordinated tasks efficiently, thus improving operational efficiency and reducing human error.

### Motivation

Automation of warehouse tasks significantly improves efficiency, reduces human errors, optimizes resource utilization, and enhances the overall workflow in a warehouse environment. This project aims to demonstrate these benefits by simulating a smart warehouse robot navigation system.

## System Description

The system consists of several components that work together to simulate the automation process:

### 1. **Map Generation**
   - The warehouse map, including all important locations such as charging stations, loading/unloading zones, and shelves, is generated and published to ROS. This serves as the environment in which the robots operate.

### 2. **Task Management**
   - The system generates tasks for the robots, such as picking up items, loading them, or moving them to specific locations within the warehouse. These tasks are assigned to robots based on available locations and priorities.

### 3. **Robot Control**
   - Robots are responsible for navigating through the warehouse to complete their tasks. They receive task assignments, navigate through the environment, and provide status updates during the process.

### 4. **Communication**
   - The robots communicate with each other and the central system using ROS topics. Custom messages are created to send and receive data, including task assignments, robot status, and other relevant information.

## Workflow

1. **Map Generation**: The map of the warehouse is generated and published to the system.
2. **Task Generation**: Load or unload tasks are created based on the warehouse requirements and assigned to the robots.
3. **Task Execution**: Robots navigate to the specified locations in the warehouse to execute the tasks (e.g., loading/unloading).
4. **Status Monitoring**: The robotâ€™s status is continuously monitored, and new tasks are assigned as needed based on the completion of the previous tasks.

## Key Concepts and Components Implemented

### 1. **Nodes**
   - ROS nodes were created to manage tasks like map generation, robot control, and task management. Nodes communicate via topics and services to exchange information.

### 2. **Topics**
   - Topics were used for communication between nodes, including task updates and status monitoring. Robots subscribe to relevant topics to receive task assignments and publish status updates.

### 3. **Messages**
   - Custom message types were defined to handle task-specific data, such as item type, task type, robot status, and location coordinates.

### 4. **Services**
   - A custom service was created to allow the central system to request specific actions from the robots, such as task assignments or status updates.

### 5. **Parameters**
   - ROS parameters were utilized to manage configurations such as task priorities, robot speed, and warehouse layout.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- Install ROS (Robot Operating System). Please follow the [ROS installation guide](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).
- Install the Gazebo simulator and RViz for visualization.

### Running the System:
1. Clone the repository to your ROS workspace.
2. Compile the workspace using:
   ```bash
   catkin_make
3. roslaunch warehouse_robot_simulation launch_file.launch
4. Use RViz to visualize the robot's movement and task execution.

### Task Assignment:
The robot will automatically receive load/unload tasks once the system is initialized. You can monitor task completion through the ROS interface.

## Conclusions
This project successfully demonstrates the use of ROS to create a smart warehouse system. Key ROS concepts such as nodes, topics, custom messages, services, and parameters were implemented to ensure smooth communication and coordination between robotic components. The integration of ROS with Gazebo and RViz enhances the realism of the simulation, showcasing how automation can improve warehouse operations.
The system can be extended further by adding more complex tasks, improving robot navigation algorithms, and integrating real-world sensors for task completion.

## Future Improvements
Add more robots to handle different types of tasks concurrently.
Implement advanced navigation and path planning algorithms.
Integrate real-time sensor data for task optimization.
